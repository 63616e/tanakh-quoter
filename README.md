## TaNaKh Quoter

I had the idea of putting all the highlighted material I have gathered by reading the Old Testament into a little notebook. Instead, I wanted to just make it into a little website. I'm a little busy these days so I didn't wanna go all React on it, thus I went full Vanilla js. 

  
## Features

This website was written over the course of about two 2 hour long standup shows on Netflix. I was bored, had an idea and finished it. No reason to maintain or further upgrade this project.

Installation? It's a website. you can clone/fork this repository if you like, but there is nothing too fancy about it.
